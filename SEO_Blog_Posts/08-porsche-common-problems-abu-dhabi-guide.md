### Should I buy a Porsche without service history?

**Strongly discouraged.** Porsche repairs are expensive—unknown history is a major risk. Pay for a comprehensive PPI if history is incomplete.

### Is the IMS bearing still a concern on newer Porsches?

**No.** Porsche redesigned the intermediate shaft bearing in 2009. 997.2, 991, and 992 models are not affected.

### How often should I service my Porsche in Abu Dhabi?

**More frequently than standard:**
- Oil changes: Every 8,000 - 10,000 km

- PDK service: Every 60,000 km
- Air filters: Every 10,000 km (dusty conditions)

### Can any mechanic service my Porsche?

**Choose carefully.** Porsches require:
- PIWIS diagnostic equipment
- Specialized tools
- Porsche-specific knowledge
- Genuine or OEM parts

**Recommendation:** Use Porsche specialists, even if independent.

### What is the most expensive Porsche repair?

**Engine and transmission failures:**
- Engine rebuild: AED 50,000 - 150,000+
- PDK replacement: AED 60,000 - 100,000+
- IMS bearing failure: AED 40,000 - 80,000+

Preventive maintenance is far more economical.

### Should I get a pre-purchase inspection for a used Porsche?

**Absolutely essential.** A comprehensive PPI costs AED 1,500 - 3,000 but can save you from AED 50,000+ in hidden problems.

### Do Porsches hold their value in UAE?

**Yes, exceptionally well.** Well-maintained Porsches with complete service history command premium resale values. Poor maintenance history significantly reduces value.

### What octane fuel should I use?
