## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 2026-02-15: Implicit User Enumeration & IDOR in Booking API
- **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated users could associate bookings with any existing user account by simply providing their email address in the request body.
- **Fix:** Switched to session-based user identification using `await auth()`. Bookings are now only associated with a `userId` if a valid session exists.
- **File:** `src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`
- **Mitigation:** Always use authenticated session data for linking resources to users instead of untrusted request payloads.
