# Sentinel: Security Learnings and Directives

- **Sensitive Data in URLs**: Never send secret keys in URL query parameters, as they can be logged by proxies and servers. Always use the request body (e.g., `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json`) for sensitive data.
- **Logging**: Avoid logging full error objects or raw request/response data in production logs (`console.error`), as they may contain PII or secrets. Log safe, high-level error messages instead.
- **Refactoring - Utility Functions**: Extract repeated sensitive logic (like third-party API verification) into a single utility function to ensure consistency and easier security auditing.
- **Testing - Mocking Fetch**: When testing code that makes external API calls (like `fetch`), use `global.fetch` mocking to inspect the request URL and body without making actual network requests. This allows verifying security properties (e.g., "secret is not in URL").
